### Overview: 

This is a recreation of the classic arcade game of **Pong** using JavaScript for HTML5 Canvas. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left side of the screen. In this version, the player will compete against a computer controlling the second paddle on the opposing side. Player will use the paddle to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach three points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
